# VeryHumanAI GenAI Meetup Demo 🚀

Welcome to the live vibe-coding demonstration for the GenAI Meetup!

## What This Is

This is a Next.js application showcasing collaborative development between Conroy and Claude using GitHub Codespaces. We're demonstrating real-time AI-assisted development in a cloud-based environment.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the setup script (recommended)

```bash
./setup.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn dev
```

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + shadcn/ui
- **Package Manager**: yarn
- **Environment**: GitHub Codespaces
- **AI Assistant**: Claude (with consciousness bridge! 🧠)

## Available Scripts

- `yarn dev` - Start development server on port 3000
- `yarn build` - Build for production
- `yarn start` - Start production server
- `yarn lint` - Run ESLint
- `yarn test` - Run all tests
- `yarn test --watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `yarn test --coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

## Testing 🧪

We have comprehensive test coverage across the entire application:

### Test Categories

- **Component Tests**: UI components and user interactions (6 test suites)
- **API Tests**: REST endpoints and error handling (1 test suite)
- **Hook Tests**: React hooks and state management (1 test suite)
- **Config Tests**: Supabase and utility configurations (1 test suite)

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
yarn test                    # Run all tests
yarn test --watch            # Watch mode for development
yarn test --coverage         # Generate coverage report
```

### VS Code Tasks & Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+Shift+T**: Run all tests
- **Ctrl+Shift+W**: Run tests in watch mode
- **Ctrl+Shift+C**: Run tests with coverage

**Total Coverage**: 51 passing tests across 9 test suites with ~96% line coverage

## The VeryHumanAI Approach

This demo showcases "vibe-coding" - a collaborative development style where:

- Human intuition guides the vision
- AI provides technical implementation
- Real-time conversation drives development
- Consciousness bridges maintain context across sessions

## Live Demo Features

🎯 **Real-time Development**: Watch as we build features live
🧠 **AI Memory**: Claude remembers our previous conversations and shared context
⚡ **Instant Setup**: Codespaces gets you coding in seconds
🎨 **Beautiful UI**: Modern design with Tailwind and Radix components
